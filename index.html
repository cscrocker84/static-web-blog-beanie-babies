<h1>The Myth of Beanie Babies</h1>
<p>Modeled after the ferocious creature known as the bear, beanie babies are toys that for some weird reason were exceedingly popular in the 90's.  They came in a bunch of different colors and styles but they were all pretty terrible.  Some people collected them and some of them became obsessed, leading to many deaths across the country.</p>
